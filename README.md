## Developer's Guide

You'll need yarn and node v8.11.3. I recommend using nvm to manage your node and npm version.

Install NVM-- see more detailed directions here https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md
```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh > ~/Desktop/install-nvm.sh

# read the file

$ bash ~/Desktop/install-nvm.sh
```

Install Yarn
```
$ brew install yarn
```

Install JS dependencies of this repo
```
$ nvm use
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Deploy -- mostly follow these instruction here https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#macos
```
$ yarn build
$ npm install -g firebase-tools
$ firebase login:ci
$ firebase use [env]
$ firebase deploy --only hosting
```

This is a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and built on top of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). That means that all of the middleware/backend is taken care of by Firebase, and when you clone this repo, all you will see is the ReactJS codebase. Don't be alarmed.

Second, the codebase as-is has the backend-for-frontend API calls but doesn't have the database(s) set up. So if you want to contribute more than just a typo fix, you'll have to reach out to me, [Maggie Moreno](https://github.com/missmaggiemo), and I'll help you get set up.

And lastly, if you are taking the time to read this, I already adore you and am so looking forward to your help.

Thank you!
